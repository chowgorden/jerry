	<h1><strong>Welcome To My <em>LIFE!</em></strong></h1>
	<p> Hi and welcome to my page. I created this page because I wanted to share the journey
that I have had in the past couple of weeks with running. All the goods, bad, and everything in between
on how it has changed my life. </p>
	<p class="disclaimer"> <strong>Disclaimer I am not a professional athlete, please do not do everything that I say am doing, 
I am not held responsible for the actions you take after reading my post.<br> <em>Thank you and enjoy the ride</em></strong>

	<h3><strong>DAY ONE</strong></h3>
	<p> To make sure that my day was going to be as smooth as possible, I bought a pair of running shoes the night before and jumped in them for 30 minutes to break them in. 
Alright, time to make the run that I have longed for since last month. As I run down South St I quickly realized that I have not ran in the several months that have passed. Every 10 minutes I am forced
to sit on the curb as cars pass judging me. No matter, at the end of the day it'll be worth it. As I pick my self up I thought about what a difference I am making in my life and what an impact it will have
as I move forward. One hour and fority five minutes later I am home; drenched in success I decided to take a picture that will commemorate today.

	<h3><strong>LAST DAY</strong></h3>
	<p> I honestly thought running was going to be my habit from yesterday going forward. However, due to some complications of not running for many moons. I have massive blisters all over my feet. I dont believe I will be continuing with my journey anymore. I bought some bandages last night to wrap my feet;
just incase my shoes rub my feet raw again. As I get out of my executive chair at work, I thought to myself; Should I even bother running back home tonight? I don't know if it is worth the effort anymore. Maybe I should just go to the gym like any regular joe, I don't need to run. Today, I worked out at the gym, but
because I was not able to stick to my commitment of running everyday. I decided to do a full body workout to make sure I punish myself. Thank you all for your support, this will be my final post as well.
